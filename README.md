## Challenge #8 - Fossil Expedition 
This park is named after an interesting geological finding here, one of the largest collections in the world. These curiosities would inspire many paleontologists to do research here, one of the first being an interesting character. Who was the paleontologist that first led a fossil expedition in the park and what museum did they fund and establish in 1908?

Not many can say they’ve been to this museum as it is closed to the public. Rumor has it, however, that a resident fossil there adorns a festive hat sometimes. Find the picture, I promise at least one exists out there.

To succeed at this challenge, you’ll need to correctly answer the following questions:
* What national park is this?
* Who first led a fossil expedition in this park and what is the name of the museum established?
* What fossil wears a festive hat at the museum identified above?
